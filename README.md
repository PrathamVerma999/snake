# Snake Game

## Introduction
This is a simple Snake game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library. The objective of the game is to control a snake and eat the food while avoiding collisions with the wall and the snake's own tail. The game is designed to be fun and challenging, and it includes a scoring system to keep track of your progress.

## Getting Started
Before you can play the game, you'll need to set up the necessary environment and dependencies.

### Prerequisites
- Python: Ensure that you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation
1. Clone or download the source code for the Snake game from the GitHub repository or obtain it from the source of your choice.
2. Extract the files to your desired directory.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the game's directory.
4. Run the game by executing the following command: `python main.py`

## How to Play
When you start the game, you will see a snake represented as a series of green squares on a black background. Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, and Right) to control the snake's direction. The snake will move continuously in the current direction until you change it. The objective of the game is to eat the food (represented as a red square) that appears randomly on the screen. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer. Try to eat as much food as possible to increase your score. Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own tail, as this will result in the game ending. The game keeps track of your score, and when the game ends, your final score will be displayed. You can restart the game by closing the game window and running it again.

## Game Components
- **Snake**: The snake is controlled by the player and consists of a head and a tail. It moves continuously in the direction specified by the player's input.
- **Food**: Food is represented as a red square. It appears randomly on the screen for the snake to eat.
- **Scoreboard**: The scoreboard keeps track of the player's score, which increases each time the snake eats food. It also displays a "Game Over" message when the game ends.

## Rules and Game Over
The game ends when the snake collides with the walls (the screen boundaries). The game also ends if the snake collides with its own tail.

## Customization
You can customize the game by modifying various parameters in the code, such as the screen size, snake speed, and appearance.
